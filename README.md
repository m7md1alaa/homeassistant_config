# Home Assistant Configuration

This repository contains my personal Home Assistant configuration. I use it to track changes and share my setup with the community.

## Disclaimer

This configuration is tailored to my specific needs and hardware. You may need to adjust it to fit your own setup. Use it as a reference or starting point for your own Home Assistant journey.

This configuration relies on the following custom components, primarily installed via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/):

- [**HACS - Home Assistant Community Store**](https://hacs.xyz/): For managing custom integrations and cards.
- [**browser_mod**](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod): Turn any browser into a controllable entity and media player.
- [**localtuya**](https://github.com/rospogrigio/localtuya): For integrating Tuya devices locally without relying on the cloud.
- [**UI Lovelace Minimalist**](https://github.com/UI-Lovelace-Minimalist/lovelace-minimalist): A minimalist Lovelace theme.
- [**lovelace-card-mod**](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod): Add CSS styles to any Lovelace card.

Make sure to install these components through HACS for the configuration to work correctly.
